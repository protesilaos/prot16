# Prot16 general resources

*Prot16* is a collection of 16-colour-palette schemes. These consist of 8 base values, divided by two groups into 'light' and 'dark', plus 8 accent values which remain constant across light and dark instantiations. The idea is to easily transition from light to dark while retaining the same feel. The accents are variants of red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, violet, and magenta.

This is the master repository of all the items I have developed. Each directory covers a specific colour scheme. It contains files related to the various ports that are available.

## Acknowledgements

I was greatly inspired in my work by Ethan Schoonover's [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). My colour schemes follow his design philosophy of a 16-colour palette that can easily transition from a light to a dark variant.

The label "Prot16" is a play on my nickname and Chris Kempson's Base16.
