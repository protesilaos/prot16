# Seabed theme

*Seabed* is a low contrast syntax theme for the Atom text editor. It is unique among my theme collection in that its two variants are essentially dark (in contrast to distinct light and dark versions). The difference between the two is one of degree: a dark and a 'lighter' dark. The colour scheme draws from aquatic representations. There is no pure red, orange, and yellow, while the rest of the palette hints heavily towards the blue side of the spectrum.
