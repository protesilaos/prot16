# Prot16 scripts

All the `*sh` files included herein are meant to work in a local environment in tandem with the [Prot16 Builder](https://github.com/protesilaos/prot16-builder).

For the Vim and Vim Airline scripts starting with `export`, the output is sent to a different folder, as these have their own GitHub repos (see [prot16-vim](https://github.com/protesilaos/prot16-vim) and [prot16-vim-airline](https://github.com/protesilaos/prot16-vim-airline)).
